    "section1Para1": "Image vectorization transforms raster images (composed of pixels) into vector graphics (built using mathematical paths and curves). While raster images lose quality when scaled, vector graphics maintain perfect clarity at any size.",
    "section1Para2": "This conversion process, also known as raster to vector conversion or vector tracing, analyzes the pixel data of your image and creates smooth, scalable paths that define shapes, colors, and gradients. The result is a fully editable SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) file.",

    "section1Item1": "Infinite Scalability: Resize to any dimension without quality loss",

    "section2ListTitle": "The Vectorization Process",
    "section2Item1": "Image Preprocessing: We enhance contrast, reduce noise, and optimize the image for vectorization using Sharp's advanced image processing capabilities.",
    "section2Item2": "Edge Detection: Our algorithm identifies edges and boundaries with sub-pixel precision, capturing fine details that other converters miss.",
    "section2Item3": "Color Quantization: Smart color reduction maintains visual fidelity while optimizing the SVG for smaller file sizes. Choose from 4 to 32 color levels based on your needs.",
    "section2Item4": "Path Generation: Mathematical curves (Bézier paths) are created following the detected edges, with adjustable smoothing for natural-looking results.",
    "section2Item5": "SVG Optimization: The final SVG is optimized using multiple techniques including attribute reduction, path merging, and whitespace removal.",

    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "subtitle": "Everything you need to know about VectorPro AI",
    "q1": "What is image vectorization?",
    "a1": "Image vectorization is the process of converting raster images (made of pixels) into vector graphics (made of mathematical paths). This allows the image to be scaled to any size without losing quality, making it perfect for logos, icons, and print materials.",
    "q2": "What file formats can I convert?",
    "a2": "VectorPro AI supports all common image formats including PNG, JPG/JPEG, WEBP, BMP, and GIF. Simply upload your image and we'll convert it to high-quality SVG format.",
    "q3": "Is VectorPro AI really free?",
    "a3": "Yes! VectorPro AI is completely free to use with no hidden fees, no signup required, and no watermarks on your downloads. We believe professional-quality vectorization should be accessible to everyone.",
    "q4": "How does the quality compare to paid tools?",
    "a4": "VectorPro AI uses advanced hybrid algorithms that rival industry standards like Vector Magic. Our intelligent edge detection, path optimization, and color quantization produce results that are often indistinguishable from expensive paid tools.",
    "q5": "Are my images secure?",
    "a5": "Absolutely. Your images are processed securely in memory and are never stored on our servers. After conversion, your files are immediately deleted. We prioritize your privacy and data security.",
    "q6": "What can I do with the SVG files?",
    "a6": "SVG files created by VectorPro AI are fully editable in any vector graphics software including Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape, Figma, and Canva. You can also edit them directly in code editors since SVG is XML-based.",
    "q7": "What's the maximum file size?",
    "a7": "You can upload images up to 10MB in size. For best results, we recommend using images with good contrast and clear edges. Larger files may take longer to process.",
    "q8": "Can I use this for commercial projects?",
    "a8": "Yes! The SVG files you create are yours to use however you like, including for commercial projects. There are no licensing restrictions on files generated by VectorPro AI."
