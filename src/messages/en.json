    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "subtitle": "Everything you need to know about vectorization",
    "q1": "What is image vectorization?",
    "a1": "Image vectorization is the process of converting raster images (made of pixels) into vector graphics (made of mathematical paths). This allows the image to be scaled to any size without losing quality, making it perfect for logos, icons, and print materials.",
    "q2": "What file formats can I convert?",
    "a2": "VectorProAI supports all common image formats including PNG, JPG/JPEG, WEBP, BMP, and GIF. Simply upload your image and we'll convert it to high-quality SVG format.",
    "q3": "Is VectorProAI really free?",
    "a3": "Yes! VectorProAI is completely free to use with no hidden fees, no signup required, and no watermarks on your downloads. We believe professional-quality vectorization should be accessible to everyone.",
    "q4": "How long does conversion take?",
    "a4": "Most conversions complete within 1-3 seconds, depending on the image size and complexity. Our optimized algorithm ensures fast processing without compromising quality.",
    "q5": "Can I use the SVG for commercial purposes?",
    "a5": "Absolutely! All SVG files you download from VectorProAI are yours to use for any purpose, including commercial projects, without any attribution required.",
    "q6": "What should I do if the quality isn't perfect?",
    "a6": "Try adjusting the quality preset, detail level, and color settings. Higher quality settings with more detail levels will produce better results, though they may take slightly longer to process."
